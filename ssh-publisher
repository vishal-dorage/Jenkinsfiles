Using Jenkins Pipeline's sshPublisher plugin ("publish over ssh"), is it possible to get the exit code and output of the command ran with execCommand (after artifacts have been transferred over)?
I'm using the plugin as follows:
script {
    echo "Sending artifacts to machine at " + remoteDirectory

    // Use of the ssh publisher plugin over SSH
    sshPublisher(
        failOnError: false,
        publishers: [
            sshPublisherDesc(
                configName: "my-drive",
                transfers: [
                    sshTransfer(
                        sourceFiles: mySourceFilesList,
                        remoteDirectory: remoteDirectory,
                        flatten: true,
                        execCommand: commandToExec,
                        execTimeout: 1800000
                    )
                ],
                sshRetry: [
                    retries: 0
                ]
            )
        ]
    )
    // How can I get the output of execCommand?
    // If the exit code was 1, I want to perform some special steps
    // I'd also like to include the output of the command in these steps
}

The wiki page here says (this is old and from 2011 though):

STDOUT and STDERR from the command execution are recorded in the
  Jenkins console.
